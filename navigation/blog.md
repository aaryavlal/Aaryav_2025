## Day 1
- Came up with idea to change the boss hitboxes, explored the code to find all code relating to box and realised I either had to change hitbox offset, or change the sprite entirely

## Day 2
- Was unable to make any useful chanegs, tried changing some values only to break the boss sprite entirely
- Thinking of adding a debug mode in the game so I can visually see where the hitbox actually is
