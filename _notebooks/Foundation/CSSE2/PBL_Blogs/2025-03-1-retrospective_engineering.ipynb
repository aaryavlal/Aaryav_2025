    "\n",
    " - Very good game, jump could be fixed so its more realistic \n",
    " - I like how you have to kill the guy, but make it so it does more damage\n",
    " - Very good editing of level\n",
    " - Its cool how it resets you after you touch the toilet\n",
    " -  I really like the boss in the background, if you fix the jump that would be cool\n",
    " - It takes too long to tap and kill the boss\n",
    " - The laser is to hard to avoid\n",
    " - The attack is cool but its also hard to keep tapping\n",

    "\n",
    "### If I had more time to continue working on the game\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve jump physics for all levels\n",
    "- Improve player collision physics with blocks (eg. teleporting straight through them)\n",
    "- Make a universal sprite throughout the levels, having the same charecter but it changes costumes to match the theme of each level\n"
